## Overview

The hotel industry plays a pivotal role within the broader hospitality sector, serving as a cornerstone for tourism and business travel. In an increasingly competitive and customer-driven market, understanding data is essential for optimizing operations, enhancing guest experiences, and driving profitability. 

By analyzing hotel performance data, this report uncovers patterns and insights that can help hotel managers and decision-makers identify opportunities for growth, address operational challenges, and improve service delivery. Additionally, the analysis provides a deeper understanding of guest behavior, booking preferences, and seasonal demand, enabling hotels to implement data-driven strategies for increased efficiency and guest satisfaction.

## Objectives

- Understand Revenue Generation Patterns:
RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Analyze revenue trends to assess overall hotel performance and profitability by evaluating how effectively rooms are being filled relative to the total available rooms.

- Evaluate Pricing Strategy:
ADR (Average Daily Rate): Determine the effectiveness of pricing strategies by analyzing how much revenue is being generated per occupied room, helping to understand market positioning and competitiveness.

- Monitor Room Utilization:
URN (Used Room Nights): Track the number of room nights actually used by guests to gauge occupancy efficiency and resource allocation within the hotel.

- Analyze Booking Behavior:
BRN (Booked Room Nights): Identify booking patterns and lead times by analyzing booked room nights, offering insights into guest behavior and the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.

- Track Room Availability at the Start of the Day:
DSRN (Day-Start Room Nights): Assess room availability at the beginning of the day to optimize room inventory management and ensure that availability matches demand.

- Measure Financial Realization:
Realization: Examine the difference between projected and actual revenue from rooms, providing insights into financial efficiency and areas where the hotel can improve revenue capture.

- Assess Occupancy Efficiency:
Occupancy Percentage: Measure the percentage of available rooms that are occupied over a given period to evaluate the hotelâ€™s capacity utilization and identify opportunities for improving occupancy rates.
